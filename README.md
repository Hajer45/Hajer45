I am a second-year computer science student with a passion for competitive programming and web development. I am currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP and I am excited to continue improving my skills in these areas. 
I am always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges, and I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise.
With a strong foundation in computer science and a dedication to lifelong learning, I am confident that I have what it takes to make a meaningful contribution to any team or project.
